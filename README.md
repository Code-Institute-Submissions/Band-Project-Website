In order to fulfill the needs of the project, I created a very visual, user friendly band website that was designed and
established through influence of genuine existing band sites found on the web such as Walking on Cars, 30 Seconds to Mars and Greenday.
I used Balsamiq tools and basic sketches on paper to be able to create drafts and templates to use as a starting point for 
developing the actual website. The concept behind the project was to capture the attention of the target audience by making
the site aesthetically appealing and user friendly. To achieve this, I used Bootstrap elements as well as Font Awesome, I kept the text on the pages of the webste to a minimum 
whilst providing and keeping very appealing aesthetics to each page. The text provided highlights the main points and grabs the
user's attention through bold, centred text that contrasts and stands out from the background image with added hover affects to
create 'life' to the pages. In order to ensure that each page displays the same signs of user friendly activity, I ensured that each one is displayed with
the exact same colours, effects and images to make the website simpler to understand and to develop familiarity across the project. Furthermore to 
making the website as user friendly as possible it needed to be responsive to ensure that the content can be viewed and used across multiple devices.

The website is used for audiences and fans to be able to effectively and efficiently book the band for their wedding and Christmas parties 
by filling in a simple booking form. There is the option to sign up for any new material as it becomes available through the Sign Up option in the navigation bar.
Audiences can also easily navigate through the website to be able to view and listen to the band's content through individual pages that contain images of the band,
audio clips of their songs and a video clip. Each tab selected will bring the user to a different page with every other tab always visible and optional.


To ensure that the project was depolyed properly, a series of testes were made. I consistently checked to ensure that the project is fully responsive by checking the 
site in the Inspect option and chaging the window size. I ran live previews of the project and tested out the links, tabs, hover effects
and playable content to ensure that the functionalities were working. Lastly, I asked my tutor to run the project to get a fresh pair of eyes to ensure it runs properly.

Whilst developing the project I had ideas that were based off of other code. In some cases this code was changed to fit my own needs. For example, the backdrop 
in the project was based off of the backdrop in the Bootstrap lesson for the Whiskey Drop page. There is similarity here as the backdrop covers the entire page 
and has been dimmed to push the main content forward on every page; a lighter background would not have achieved this effect so well.
The hr element used in the same lesson is used to split up the page and to highlight the Heading in my project. I made a few changes however such as the colour and
length of the element so that the heading stands out clearer. I copied the code used in the Resume project lesson when navigating through the different links that
keeps the user on the same page so that they 'stay with us'. I found that this was useful when deploying it in my own project as it keeps the user on track.
